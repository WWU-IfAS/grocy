grocy is not an enterprise application and neither one you (should) host publicly (means without authentication) on the internet.

So unless something really bad can be abused _unauthenticated_, please just open a regular issue on the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/grocy/grocy/issues/new/choose).

You can also contact me directly, please see [berrnd.de](https://berrnd.de) for any contact information.
